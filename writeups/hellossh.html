        Yeah they did, however it was more interesting than I originally thought. Whenever an SSH key changes, it means that the trust between your system and the remote connection has been disrupted. I exclusively connect to my Lab LAN via a VPN connection, meaning we can ignore the possibility of a MiTM attack, since my SSH keys had authenticated properly.
        <br><br>
        So this means a more sophisticated attack than simple MiTM. I don't go through with connecting via SSH, and instead use the web console I have only on my LAN. I check the stored SSH keys and can see that it has changed from what I had. I first re-installed my SSH server binary, and the key went back to normal, odd. I now sign into SSH and start the actual Incident Response
        <br><br> I first checked my Firewall, being relatively unexperienced with Linux Networking I use UFW. I check the status.
        <img class="writeupimgtext" src="/img/writeups/woahssh/ufwdisabled.png" alt="The default alert message for SSH keys changing, with the keys modified" />
        I then check my .bash_history, and find a blanked out section 
        <img class="writeupimgtext" src="/img/writeups/woahssh/wherego.png" alt="The default alert message for SSH keys changing, with the keys modified" />
        Well obviously someone has accessed my server, now to figure out what they did. First thing I check is for any unauthorized connections in the server. And immediately found port 5555 in use by an unknown PID. I find the process running it, and remove the reverse shell file in PostGreSQL
        <br><br> But wait, this server is incredibly basic, what could you be using PostGreSQL for? I originally installed it as a dependancy for Syanpse Matrix, a project I started working on, then gave up on due to requiring too many changes in my infrastructure.
        <br><br> I was having difficulties with PostGreSQL, so I decided, you know what, Let me log in as its user and see whats up... And thats where the issue started. I was in a rush and had given the PostGreSQL a user on my server, and did not set a password for said user. Whoops..
        <br><br> This was the first mistake of many, My second mistake was a cronjob running as my user. They elevated their permissions to root, by simply editing the script that it ran, as it was in-correctly permissioned.
        <br><br> So they had my user, what did they do. They installed an SSH Backdoor, to store password hashes, My user does not run as root, so they could not access etc/shadow. Assumedly, they would decrypt this hash in order to get my password. From there, they could sudo and get root.
        <br><br> There is also a second reason they might want my password, Credential Stuffing, the act of abusing re-used passwords. I had my Email publicly available, and would probably try that password on everything I use. I don't re-use passwords. And the email I publicly posted I set up for only this purpose.
        <br><br> So I found two modifications so far, and a service I need to remove. I then found 2 rootkits, and promptly removed them.
        <br><br> So what did we learn?
        <br>1. Don't give services shells
        <br>2. Don't run cronjobs insecurely.
        <br>3. Use your head. 
        <br> <br> There are a handful of things I will not be covering on this page, due to their risk. If you would like access to the deep dive into Who and Why. Email me on the about page.
